# 🎨 Professional Design Update - Minimalist Corporate

## Overview

## Design Philosophy

### Before: Consumer/Playful
- Bright, saturated colors (purple, blue, pink, orange, green)
- Colorful gradients and backgrounds
- Feels like a consumer app

### After: Professional/Corporate
- **Monochromatic palette**: Black, white, and grayscale
- **Strategic color accents**: Only for critical information
- **Clean minimalism**: Like Bloomberg Terminal, Stripe, or Linear
- Feels like enterprise business intelligence software
